# Introduction

## Core Analogy: AI is this generation's computer
Everyone will need to know how to use it in their area of engagement

# Introduction

## Current State: Changing of the guard

### Development of new infrastructure
- Innovation is happening in software and tech

### Business world should be getting ready
- There will be a significant change in skills needed to perform your job

# Introduction

## Key Concept: AI has commoditized expertise
- Cost and time needed to implement knowledge is reduced by orders of magnitude
- People will need basic knowledge in many domains rather than specializing in a single subject
- Work will revolve around one's ability to effectively use new tools

---

# New skills

## Using with Agents
- You will need to learn how to integrate LLMs directly into your workflow

**Example: Kilo in VS Code**
KiloCode is an extension that allows agents to generate code directly in your editor

# New skills

## Markdown
- Use text effectively to interact with LLMs

**Example: README.md**
Project documentation created in markdown and can be rendered in many user friendly formats.

# New skills

## Version Control
- LLMs create large amounts of data quickly. 
- It is critical to systematically track changes, especially in a team setting.

**Example: Git**
Git is the industry standard for version control in software development. Newer tools for managing AI content will likely be similar to or built on top of Git.

# General Use Cases

**Automation Helpers**
- Build reusable helper functions to speed up recurring workflows.

**Report Drafting**
- Draft new reports by summarizing and restructuring content from existing documents.

**Model & Process Improvement**
- Apply code-driven changes to models and processes to unlock new functionality, improve performance, and reduce manual work.

# Specific Use Cases

## Health insurance plan comparison tool
- Compare and contrast lengthy technical documents.
- Find differences in wording, meaning, and formatting.
- It can be useful to create a boilerplate template and then customize it for specific tasks.

# Specific Use Cases

## RPEC tool
- Objective: Create a new report from an existing report and new data.
- Upload the existing report, new data, figures, and configure parameters to guide the generation.
- This application is specifically designed to produce a new mortality outlook section.

# Advice for Adoption

1. **Get a baseline:** watch videos on topics of interest, start with an easy and familiar task
2. **Practice deliberately:** follow a tutorial, recreate a workflow or process you are already know
3. **Build a small project:** pick a personal interest with an outcome you'll actually use and enjoy
4. **Create a real product or service:** make it shareable so others can try it and give feedback

*All of these steps will need to be repeated several times*

# Sample Projects

## Minesweeper
- Used AI agents to create a playable version of minesweeper with a single prompt
- Initial updates were basic features like colors and a settings menu
- Added more ambitious features like scoring and game analysis

# Summary

**Adjust to the culture shock and new paradigm** 
- AI is the expert, people are the managers

**Embrace new skill sets** 
- Your will learn different ways to manage and steer AI generation

**Active learning** 
- Passion projects are a great way to grasp AI capabilities
