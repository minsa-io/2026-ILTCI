# Introduction

## **Current State: Changing of the guard**

### Development of new infrastructure
- Innovation is happening in software and tech

### Business world should be getting ready
- There will be a significant change in skills needed to perform your job

---

# Introduction

## **Key Concept: AI has commoditized expertise**
- Cost and time needed to implement knowledge is reduced by orders of magnitude
- People will need to basic knowledge in many domains rather than specializing in a single subject
- Work will revolve around one's ability to effectively use new tools

# New skills

**Using with Agents**
- You will need to learn how to integrate LLMs directly into your workflow

**Example: Kilo in VS Code**
- KiloCode is an extension that allows agents to generate code directly in your editor

# New skills

**Markdown**
- Use text effectively to interact with LLMs

**Example: README.md**
Project documentation created in markdown and can be rendered in many user friendly formats.

# New skills

**Version Control**
- LLMs create large amounts of data quickly. 
- It is critical to systematically track changes, especially in a team setting.

**Example: Git**
- Git is the industry standard for version control in software development. Newer tools for managing AI content will likely be similar to or built on top of Git.

# General Use Cases

**Common uses insurance companies**
- Make helper functions for common tasks
- Draft new reports from existing documents
- Programmatic updates for models and processes

---

# Specific Use Cases

**Health insurance plan comparison tool**
- Compare and contrast lengthy technical documents.
- Find differences in wording, meaning, and formatting.
- It can be useful to create a boilerplate template and then customize it for specific tasks.

# Specific Use Cases

**RPEC tool**
Create a new report from an existing report and new data.

This application is designed to produce a new mortality outlook section. Upload the existing report, new data, figures, and configure parameters to guide the generation.

# Advice for Adoption

1. **Get a baseline:** watch videos on topics of interest, start with something easy for you
2. **Try something:** do tutorials, recreate something that you are familiar with
3. **Do a project:** make something of personal interest to you
4. **Create a real product or service:** make something that you can share with others

*All of these steps will need to be repeated several times*

# Sample Projects

**Menu Gen**
Take a picture of a text menu and get a new menu with images for each dish.

  <img src="assets/menugen-images.png" alt="menu with images" class="img-large">
</div>

# Sample Projects

**Minesweeper**
- Used AI agents to create a playable version of minesweeper with a single prompt
- Initial updates were basic features like colors and a settings menu
- Added more ambitious features like scoring and game analysis

# Summary

**Adjust to the culture shock and new paradigm** 
- AI is the expert, people are the managers

**Embrace new skill sets** 
- Your will learn different ways to manage and steer AI generation

**Active learning** 
- Passion projects are a great way to grasp AI capabilities
