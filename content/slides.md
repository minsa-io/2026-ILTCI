# Introduction

## **Core Analogy: AI is this generation's computer**
Everyone will need to know how to use it in their area of engagement

# Introduction

## **Key Concept: AI has commoditized expertise**
Costs (and revenue) are massively reduced

---

# Current State

**Development of new infrastructure**
- Innovation is happening in software and tech

**Business world should be getting ready**
- Significant changes in business won't happen for years
- People will need new basic skills to survive  

---

# New skills

**Using with Agents**
- You will need to learn how to integrate LLMs directly into your workspace

# New skills

**Markdown**
- Use text effectively to interact with LLMs

---

# New skills

**Version Control**
- Manage content generated by LLMs

# General Pattern

1. Groundbreaking theoretical concept proven possible (Attention is All You Need, GPT-2)
2. Academic result becomes good enough in quality for experts, initial use cases (GPT-3)
3. Time to complete tasks reduced by several multiples (i.e 3x) leads to cost savings
4. Time to complete tasks reduced by orders of magnitude (i.e >10x) leads to new capabilities
5. Broadening of breadth leads to innovative ideas
6. Sufficiently many new ideas become successful to permanently influence products and services
7. New products and services become differentiated and specialized

# General Use Cases

**Common uses insurance companies**
- Draft new reports from existing documents
- Make helper functions for common tasks
- Programmatic updates for models

---

# Specific Use Cases

**RPEC tool**
Create a new report from an existing report and new data.

This application is designed to produce a new mortality outlook section. Upload the existing report, new data, figures, and configure parameters to guide the generation.

# Specific Use Cases

**Policy page comparison tool**
Compare and contrast lengthy technical documents. Find differences in wording, meaning, and formatting.

# Advice for Adoption

1. **Get a baseline:** watch videos on topics of interest, start with something easy for you
2. **Try something:** do tutorials on a topic of interest, recreate something that you are familiar with
3. **Do a project:** pick something of personal interest to you
4. **Create a real product or service:** quality exceeds current standards

*All of these steps will need to be repeated several times*

# Sample Projects

**Menu Gen**
Take a picture of a text menu and create a new menu with images for each dish.

<div class="image-container">
  <img src="assets/menugen-upload.png" alt="original menu" class="img-large">
  <img src="assets/menugen-images.png" alt="menu with images" class="img-large">
</div>

---

# Sample Projects

**Minesweeper**
Used AI agents to create a playable version of minesweeper with a single prompt

Initial updates were basic features like colors and a settings menu

By gaining familiarity with the code base and agent capabilities, more ambitious features like scoring and game analysis were added

# Summary

**Adjust to the culture shock and new paradigm** 
- AI is the expert, not people

**Adjust to new skill sets** 
- You will do work by managing AI

**Active learning** 
- Passion projects are easier than ever
