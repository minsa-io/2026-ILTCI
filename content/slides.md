# General Pattern

1. Groundbreaking theoretical concept proven possible (Attention is All You Need, GPT-2)
2. Academic result becomes good enough in quality for experts, initial use cases (GPT-3)
3. Time to complete tasks reduced by several multiples (i.e 3x) leads to cost savings
4. Time to complete tasks reduced by orders of magnitude (i.e >10x) leads to new capabilities
5. Broadening of breadth leads to innovative ideas
6. Sufficiently many new ideas become successful to permanently influence products and services
7. New products and services become differentiated and specialized

# Advice for Adoption

1. **Get a baseline:** watch videos on topics of interest, start with something easy for you
2. **Try something:** do tutorials on a topic of interest, recreate something that you are familiar with
3. **Do a project:** pick something of personal interest to you
4. **Create a real product or service:** quality exceeds current standards

*All of these steps will need to be repeated several times*
