# Layout specifications for image placement
# Format: layout_name -> list of image area definitions
# Each area defines where an image can be placed for that layout
#
# For layouts with template PICTURE placeholders, use: { name: "placeholder_name" }
# For layouts needing custom positioning, use: { left, top, width, height }
# All dimensions in inches

# Layouts that support images
# Note: Current template.potx does not have PICTURE placeholders,
# so we define positioning areas based on the layout design
